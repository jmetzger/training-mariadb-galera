# Monitoring 

## What to monitor ? 

  * Single nodes 
  * wsrep_local_state_comment -> synced # should be synced (but problem if it will not be on synced for a longer time)
  * wsrep_cluster_status # Primary // Non-Primary is BAD !! 
  * Does the node run
  * Necessary ports available 

## set threads in galera according to cert_deps 

```
Sequentially in Parallel

Last, you might monitor wsrep_cert_deps_distance. It will tell you the average distance between the lowest and highest sequence number, values a node can potentially apply in parallel.

Basically, this is the optimal value to set wsrep_slave_threads or wsrep_applier_threads, since itâ€™s pointless to assign more slave threads than the number of transactions that can be applied in parallel.
