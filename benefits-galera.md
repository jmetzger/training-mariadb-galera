# Benefits of galera cluster 

  * Redundancy of data (if one node crashes, you still have the other nodes) 
  * Self-Healing (Node, that is not in sync or not reachable if evicted after a while) 
  * Auto-Provisioning (Automatically setting up a new node with data) 
  * Basic monitoring of all nodes (so from node to node), if they are healthy 
  * Lot's of protection against split-brain situation
